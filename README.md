Stencils
========

A repository for stencils from WireframeSketcher's Mockups Gallery. Mockups Gallery website can be found here: http://wireframesketcher.com/mockups.

Project structure
-----------------

This is an Eclipse project that you can checkout to your workspace. You can also use standalone WireframeSketcher for that but you'll need to install EGit plugin first.

All stencils are found in "assets" directory. You can edit them using WireframeSketcher and then preview them directly in the Palette View.

Contributing
------------

This repository is a mirror of an internal WireframeSketcher's repository. However you can use it to create pull requests and we'll do our best to merge them and then make them part of Mockups Gallery website.
